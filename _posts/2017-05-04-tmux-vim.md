title: Vim and Tmux Essentials
---
If you've always been curious about improving your workflow with tmux, but not
sure where to start, here's a quick start with the essentials. The first thing
we're going to start with is navigation.

A quick word of warning, these directions are for tmux 2.4, and are
incompatible with older versions.

You'll want to add these commands to your `~/.tmux.conf` file. They'll give you
the ability to seamlessly switch between vim and tmux panes using a control +
movement key(hjkl).

```tmux
  # smart pane switching with awareness of vim splits
  bind -n C-h run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iq vim && tmux send-keys C-h) || tmux select-pane -L"
  bind -n C-j run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iq vim && tmux send-keys C-j) || tmux select-pane -D"
  bind -n C-k run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iq vim && tmux send-keys C-k) || tmux select-pane -U"
  bind -n C-l run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iq vim && tmux send-keys C-l) || tmux select-pane -R"
  bind -n C-\ run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iq vim && tmux send-keys 'C-\\') || tmux select-pane -l"
```

Once you've setup your tmux config, you'll also need to install a vim plugin.

```vim
  Plug 'christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator'
```

The next thing we're going to do is install [Vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux),
which will let you easily interact with tmux from vim.

```vim
  Plug 'benmills/vimux'
```

Once we've installed vimux, we'll want to setup our testrunner to take
advantage of tmux. I personally use
[vim-test](https://github.com/janko-m/vim-test), which can be set to use vim
with the following command in your vimrc:

```vim
  let test#strategy = "vimux"
```

The last thing we'll want to do is setup a shortcut for quickly fullscreening
our vimux pane. This is useful for viewing test output, or if we want to check
git history, etc..

```vim
  map <Leader>z :VimuxZoomRunner<CR>
```

These are just the basics, and there's a lot more you can do to boost your
productivity with tmux. I think these are a good starting point for a saner
test environment in vim though.
